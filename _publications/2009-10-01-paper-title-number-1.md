excerpt: 'This study explores a chatbot developed using the LLaMA framework, specifically tailored to address academic queries at VIIT. To generate contextually appropriate responses, the system integrates information from MongoDB using a combination of embedding techniques and tools from Hugging Face. By leveraging MongoDB, the chatbot retrieves relevant institute-related information and produces clear and coherent answers through carefully fine-tuned LLaMA models. To evaluate the effectiveness of different models in delivering accurate and pertinent responses, a comparative analysis is conducted. This chatbot aims to assist students in real-time, enhancing communication with the institution and facilitating a smoother, more efficient user experience.'
