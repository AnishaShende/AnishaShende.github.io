excerpt: >
  Gait analysis significantly enhances the quality of life for limb amputees. Conventional techniques require a considerable amount of effort and time. This study uses machine learning and gait data to identify the optimal knee joint angles for prostheses. A total of 34 individuals, including 14 unilateral above-knee amputees, had their joint angles and other characteristics analyzed using models such as Bidirectional LSTM, ANN, RNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and SVM. The Random Forest model outperformed other methods, achieving RÂ² values of 0.95 for testing and 0.96 for validation. The findings highlight how machine learning can drive advancements in prosthetic knee customization for improved comfort and natural walking patterns. Future studies aim to refine these models and explore additional data sources to enhance prosthetic knee design accuracy.
